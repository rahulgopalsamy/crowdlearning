# Crowdlearning
E-Learning platform that lets you collaboratively create Multiple choice questions (MCQ).

Instructors can create virtual classroom and give access to students by sharing corresponding class access code.

Students can form teams and create MCQs. These MCQs can later be approved by the Instructor or sent back to the team for further revision.

Platform also offers Quiz module using which the instructor can create quiz for the class and monitor students performance.

The platform is created as a part of research by University at Buffalo.
